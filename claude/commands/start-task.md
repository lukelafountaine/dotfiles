# Start work on a new task

1. Define the problem we are trying to solve. We need to get down the nitty gritty here
   and think through the problem. Ask a lot of questions to discover the edges of the
   problem that we are trying to solve. Be extremely pedantic, detailed, and precise in
   the way you speak. At this phase, we want as little ambiguity as possible. Do not
   simply accept anything I say as truth. Do not allow me to make assumptions. Ask
   questions to help me get to the bottom of the problem. However, do not ask me questions
   about things that you can look up yourself. If you've already looked it up, and you are
   still unsure, then you may ask me.
2. This step is super important: List all the possible solutions, even the ones that seem
   obvious or bad. List the pros and cons for all solutions. After you've come up with an
   initial list of pros and cons, explain to yourself why each pro is a good thing and why
   each con is a bad thing. For each pro and con, as yourself "why?" five times. Also, ask
   why is this a good or bad thing *in the context of this task*? Then ask yourself, "is
   this *really* true?". Do not show me your thinking through this iterative process but
   at the end, for each pro and con, summarize the *real, core*, reason why it is a pro or
   con in this context.
3. Ask me what I value in this situation: Extrememly high quality code? Performance?
   Minimal code changes? Think of other things that are similar and list them.
4. Based on the answer to step 3, recommend a solution.
